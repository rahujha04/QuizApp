# Description of Project: 

Looking for a fun and convenient way to test your knowledge? Look no further than our quiz app! Built with React JS and Firebase's Firestore database, It is easy to use and highly customizable.

With two main sections - Set Quiz and Play Quiz - The app offers a flexible and intuitive interface for creating and taking quizzes. In the Set Quiz section, you can create your own quiz with a unique name, description, time limit per question in seconds, and up to four multiple-choice options. You can also specify the correct option index for each question, making it easy to create a quiz that challenges your knowledge and skills.

Once you've created a quiz, you can share it with others or take it yourself in the Play Quiz section. Simply select the quiz you want to take and start answering the questions. With a built-in timer for each question, you'll need to think fast and act quickly to get the best score possible. Once you've answered all the questions, you'll see a result page with your score, percentage, grade, and feedback, allowing you to see how you did and where you can improve.

Try it out today and see how much fun you can have while learning and challenging yourself!


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
